## 🔧 Usage

These diagrams can be:
1. **Viewed on GitHub** - Automatic Mermaid rendering in markdown
2. **Rendered locally** - Using VS Code Mermaid extensions
3. **Exported** - To PNG/SVG for presentations
4. **Referenced** - In documentation and papers

**Note**: All diagrams have been updated to reflect the current implementation with scalable graph management and C-value free episode handling.

Linkset‑First: The geDIG IG component is now paper‑aligned (Linkset‑IG). When using Core directly in code snippets, prefer passing a `linkset_info` payload to avoid the deprecated graph‑IG fallback (which now emits a one‑time warning).
