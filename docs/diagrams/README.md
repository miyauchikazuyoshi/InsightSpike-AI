### Phase 2 & 3 Implementation Updates

### Scalable Graph Architecture
The diagrams now reflect the **NP-hard GED optimization** solutions:

1. **Phase 2: Scalable Graph Construction**
   - FAISS-based approximate nearest neighbor search
   - O(n²) → O(n log n) complexity reduction
   - Configurable top-k neighbor selection

2. **Phase 3: Hierarchical Graph Management**
   - 3-layer hierarchy: Episodes → Clusters → Super-clusters
   - O(log n) search complexity
   - 100x+ compression for large datasets
   - Dynamic document addition without full rebuild

### Graph-Centric Memory Management
The diagrams now show the **C-value free** implementation:

- **Dynamic Importance Calculation**:
  - Graph degree (40%)
  - Access frequency (30%)
  - Time decay (30%)

- **Graph-Informed Integration**:
  - Base threshold: 0.85
  - Graph bonus: -0.1 if connected
  - Weight = graph_strength OR similarity

- **Automatic Splitting**:
  - Detects neighbor conflicts
  - Splits episodes to maintain coherence
  - Self-attention-like behavior
