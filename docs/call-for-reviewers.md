# Call for Reviewers / Collaborators

We’re opening geDIG for early community review before arXiv submission. If your research touches:

- Information thermodynamics, Active Inference (FEP), MDL
- Graph RAG, multi-hop reasoning, dynamic knowledge bases
- Cognitive architectures, discrete free-energy models

We’d love your feedback or collaboration on Phase 2 (offline rewiring, global consistency).

How to help:
- Open an Issue with the “Review” label (theory / experiments / reproducibility)
- Suggest edits via PRs (typos, clarity, code hygiene)
- Share domain-specific insights (evaluation protocols, datasets)

Contact:
- X (Twitter): @your_handle
- Email: replace@with-your-contact
