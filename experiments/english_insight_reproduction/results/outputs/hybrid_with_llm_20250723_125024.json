Therefore, the question 'Can consciousness be understood through information theory?' does not answer the question 'Can consciousness be understood through information theory?'\nThe idea that we can derive information from information theory is simply not true. The reason, however, is that knowledge theory offers a new way to understand the physical world, and that it is indeed possible to use information theory as an instrument.\nThe concept of consciousness is a well-established concept",
