# Integrated RAG Memory Experiment

This experiment tested the integration of RAG capabilities with the InsightSpike-AI memory system.

## Overview

Conducted on June 13, 2025, this experiment evaluated:
- RAG precision results
- Memory evolution over time
- Baseline comparison with traditional approaches

## Results

### Files
- **integrated_rag_memory_results_20250613_005205.json**: Complete experiment results
- **visualizations/**: Visual representations of the results

### Key Metrics

The experiment tested various question categories:
- Probability paradoxes (e.g., Monty Hall problem)
- Mathematical paradoxes (e.g., Zeno's paradox)
- Philosophical paradoxes (e.g., identity philosophy)
- Concept hierarchies
- Conceptual revolutions

### Baseline Comparison

Traditional approach results showed:
- Low response quality (0-26.7%)
- No insight detection
- Consistent response times (~0.10s)
- Zero spike counts

## Significance

This was an early experiment in integrating RAG capabilities with InsightSpike-AI's memory system, providing baseline measurements for future improvements.
