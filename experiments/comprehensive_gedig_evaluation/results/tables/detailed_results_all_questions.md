## Key Insights

1. **Perfect Performance on Hard Questions**: All 5 hard questions achieved spike detection with high confidence
2. **Highest Confidence**: Question 7 about fundamental nature of reality (99.5%)
3. **Failed Detections**: 
   - Feedback loops (too simple/direct)
   - Collective intelligence (insufficient cross-domain connections)
   - Self-organizing systems (abstract without specific integration)
4. **Processing Efficiency**: Consistent sub-40ms performance enables real-time applications
5. **Temporal Consistency**: Instantaneous ΔGED implementation improves both speed and confidence
