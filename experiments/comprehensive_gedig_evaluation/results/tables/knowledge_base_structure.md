## Connection Patterns

### Within-Phase Connections
- Phase 1-1: 85% connected (foundational concepts highly related)
- Phase 2-2: 70% connected (relational concepts moderately linked)
- Phase 3-3: 75% connected (integrative ideas well connected)
- Phase 4-4: 60% connected (questions more independent)
- Phase 5-5: 80% connected (insights highly interconnected)

### Cross-Phase Connections (Dynamic Thresholds)
- Adjacent phases (e.g., 1-2): threshold = 0.35
- Two phases apart (e.g., 1-3): threshold = 0.30
- Three phases apart (e.g., 1-4): threshold = 0.25
- Four phases apart (e.g., 1-5): threshold = 0.20

## Key Insights from Structure

1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Knowledge builds from basic concepts to transcendent insights
2. **Dense Connectivity**: Average 9.62 connections per node enables rich concept integration
