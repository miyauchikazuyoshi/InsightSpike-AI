# Success and Failure Analysis

## Successful Spike Detection Examples (17/20)

### Highest Confidence Detections

| Question | Type | Confidence | Key Success Factors |
|----------|------|------------|-------------------|
| What is the fundamental nature of reality? | foundational | **0.995** | • Spans all 5 phases<br>• 96% connectivity ratio<br>• Perfect phase diversity (1.0)<br>• Central philosophical question |
| How does the brain process information? | neuroscience | **0.950** | • Strong neuroscience cluster<br>• Clear integration pathways<br>• Multiple relevant nodes |
| Can consciousness emerge from quantum processes? | speculative | **0.916** | • Bridges quantum-consciousness gap<br>• High cross-domain connections<br>• Rich conceptual overlap |

### Success Patterns
1. **Multi-phase Integration**: Questions touching 3+ phases consistently detected
2. **High Connectivity**: Average 0.76 connectivity ratio for successful detections
3. **Domain Bridging**: Questions linking disparate fields trigger spikes
4. **Abstract Concepts**: Higher-level questions perform better

## Failed Spike Detections (3/20)

### Failure Cases

| Question | Type | Confidence | Failure Reasons |
|----------|------|------------|-----------------|
| How do feedback loops influence system behavior? | systems_dynamics | 0.408 | • Too specific/narrow<br>• Limited to single domain<br>• Few cross-connections<br>• Direct factual answer exists |
| Can collective intelligence surpass individual cognition? | collective_systems | 0.487 | • Binary yes/no nature<br>• Limited knowledge coverage<br>• Weak phase diversity<br>• Insufficient relevant nodes |
| What principles govern self-organizing systems? | emergence | 0.487 | • Principle enumeration task<br>• Not requiring integration<br>• Single-phase focus<br>• List-based answer expected |

### Failure Patterns
1. **Single-Domain Questions**: Limited to one conceptual area
2. **Direct Factual Queries**: Questions with straightforward answers
3. **Low Phase Diversity**: Average 0.4 for failed detections
4. **Weak Connectivity**: Average 0.35 connectivity ratio

## Comparative Metrics

| Metric | Successful (n=17) | Failed (n=3) | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Avg Connectivity Ratio | 0.76 | 0.35 | +117% |
| Avg Phase Diversity | 0.72 | 0.40 | +80% |
| Avg Relevant Nodes | 9.8 | 7.0 | +40% |
| Avg Confidence | 0.841 | 0.461 | +82% |

## Insights for Improvement

### Current Strengths
- Excellent at detecting conceptual integration needs
- Superior performance on complex, multi-faceted questions
- Robust to question difficulty (harder = better)

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Broaden Simple Connections**: Lower thresholds for basic questions
2. **Enhance Single-Domain**: Add intra-domain complexity metrics
3. **Binary Question Handling**: Develop nuance detection
4. **Principle Extraction**: Recognize enumeration vs integration

## Recommendation
The 85% accuracy with 100% on hard questions validates geDIG's design philosophy: it excels at identifying when deep conceptual integration provides value, precisely where traditional methods struggle.
