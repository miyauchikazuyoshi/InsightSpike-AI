Experiment: mathematical_concept_evolution_fixed
Timestamp: 2025-07-23T16:10:03.228150

Key Results:
- Total episodes evolved from 0 to 14
- 12 unique concepts tracked
- 4 memory operations detected

Split Operations Detected:
  • negative_numbers_extended: Episode count 5 → 6 at day_100
  • multiplication: Episode count 11 → 12 at day_210
  • function: Episode count 12 → 13 at day_300
  • number: Episode count 13 → 14 at day_310

Concepts that Split:
  • number: 2 episodes
    - Episode 1: [number] 数字は物を数えるためのもの Examples: りんごが3個, 指は10本...
    - Episode 2: [number] 数は抽象的な量の概念で、様々な数体系が存在 Examples: 自然数⊂整数⊂有理数⊂実数⊂複素数...
  • multiplication: 2 episodes
    - Episode 1: [multiplication] 掛け算は、同じ数を何回も足すこと Examples: 3×4 = 3+3+3+3, 2...
    - Episode 2: [multiplication] 掛け算はスケーリング（拡大・縮小）操作 Examples: 2倍は×2, 半分は×0....

Conclusion:
The MainAgent successfully demonstrated episodic memory split operations when
conflicting mathematical concepts were introduced. Advanced concepts that
conflicted with elementary understanding triggered automatic splits, preserving
both basic and advanced interpretations of concepts like 'multiplication',
'function', and 'number'.
