# Episode Management Analysis

This experiment analyzed episode management capabilities in InsightSpike-AI.

## Overview

This analysis examined how InsightSpike-AI manages episodes through:
- Deduplication
- Merging similar episodes
- Splitting complex episodes
- Pruning low-importance episodes

## Results

- **episode_management_analysis.png**: Visualization of episode management performance

## Significance

Episode management is a key feature that distinguishes InsightSpike-AI from traditional RAG systems. This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of automatic episode management.
