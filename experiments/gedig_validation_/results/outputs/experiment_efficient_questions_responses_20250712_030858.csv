direct_llm,Q2,How does life maintain order despite the second law of thermodynamics?,insight_required,N/A,"The first law of thermodynamics is that the observer of an object is at least temporarily at rest. In fact, in the second law of thermodynamics, a non-standard function of the observer is the observer of the object and at least temporarily at rest. This is not a non-standard function of the observer of the object and at least temporarily at rest. Q: What has been the",67,0.3,1.31,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,N/A
