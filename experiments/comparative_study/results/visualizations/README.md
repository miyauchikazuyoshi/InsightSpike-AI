# Query Transformation Visualizations

These visualizations demonstrate how InsightSpike's query transformation mechanism works during the comparative study experiment.

## Files

### Animated Visualizations
- `query_transformation_animation.gif` - Complete animated demonstration of query transformation
- `gedig_animation.gif` - Full geDIG theory animation showing insight detection
- `gedig_simple_animation.gif` - Simplified version of geDIG mechanism

### Static Visualizations
- `query_transformation_stages.png` - Shows the 4-stage evolution process
- `query_transformation_metrics.png` - Metrics tracking over transformation cycles
- `query_embedding_evolution.png` - Movement through embedding space

### Timestamped Versions
- `*_20250713_182547.png` - Original versions with timestamps
- Files without timestamps are the clean versions for documentation

## Generation Timeline
- **15:08-15:22**: Animated GIFs created to demonstrate dynamic processes
- **18:25**: Static PNG visualizations created for detailed analysis
- **18:36-18:45**: Comparative study experiment executed

All visualizations were created on 2025-07-13 as part of the comparative study experiment to illustrate InsightSpike's query transformation and geDIG mechanisms.
