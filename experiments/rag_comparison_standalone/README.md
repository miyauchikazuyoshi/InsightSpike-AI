# Standalone RAG Comparison Experiment

This directory contains the standalone RAG comparison experiment results.

## Overview

This experiment compared different RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems on various performance metrics.

## Results

- **comparison_results.json**: Detailed comparison metrics between different RAG implementations
- **rag_comparison.png**: Visualization of the comparison results

## Key Findings

The experiment evaluated multiple RAG systems including:
- InsightSpike-AI's custom RAG implementation
- Standard vector-based RAG
- Hybrid approaches

Results show performance comparisons across:
- Retrieval accuracy
- Processing speed
- Memory efficiency
- Scalability
