1. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously, ensuring thread safety but limiting true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.
   Domain: programming
   Depth: technical
   Concepts: python, gil, parallelization, memory
   Length: 184 characters

2. Python uses reference counting with cycle detection for memory management, automatically deallocating objects when their reference count reaches zero.
   Domain: programming
   Depth: technical
   Concepts: python, garbage_collection, memory
   Length: 150 characters

3. Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in training data, resulting in poor generalization. Regularization techniques like L1/L2 penalties help prevent this.
