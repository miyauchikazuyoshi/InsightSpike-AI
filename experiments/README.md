# InsightSpike-AI Experiments

This directory contains experiments validating the geDIG framework and InsightSpike-AI implementation.

## 📊 Published Experiments (geDIG Paper v3)

### 1. Comprehensive geDIG Evaluation (`comprehensive_gedig_evaluation/`)
Main experiment reported in the paper with:
- 100-item hierarchical knowledge base
- 20 test questions (Easy: 5, Medium: 10, Hard: 5)
- **Results**: 85% overall accuracy, 100% on hard questions
- ΔGED and ΔIG analysis demonstrating difficulty reversal phenomenon

### 2. English Insight Reproduction (`english_insight_reproduction/`)
Validation experiment showing:
- Real-time insight detection (45ms average)
- Knowledge graph evolution visualization
- Spike detection mechanism demonstration

### 3. Mathematical Concept Evolution (`mathematical_concept_evolution/`)
Explores episodic memory splitting during concept learning:
- Elementary → Middle school mathematical concepts
- Demonstrates knowledge structure reorganization
- Validates hippocampal replay analogy
