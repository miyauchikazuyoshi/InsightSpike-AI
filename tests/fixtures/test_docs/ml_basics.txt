Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error

Machine learning is used in various applications such as email filtering, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
