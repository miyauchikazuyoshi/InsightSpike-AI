Entropy is a fundamental concept in physics that measures the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. 
It was first introduced by Rudolf Clausius in the 1850s in the context of thermodynamics.

In information theory, Claude Shannon redefined entropy as a measure of information content or uncertainty.
The mathematical formula for Shannon entropy is H = -Σ p(x) log p(x), where p(x) is the probability of each possible outcome.

This connection between thermodynamic entropy and information entropy reveals a deep relationship between physics and information.
The principle suggests that information is physical and has thermodynamic consequences.
