Consciousness remains one of the deepest mysteries in science. Some theories propose that consciousness 
emerges from complex information integration in the brain, as suggested by Integrated Information Theory (IIT).

The theory proposes that consciousness corresponds to a system's integrated information (Φ), 
which measures how much information is generated by a system above and beyond its parts.

Interestingly, this mathematical framework shares similarities with concepts from quantum mechanics and information theory.
Some researchers speculate that consciousness might involve quantum processes in microtubules within neurons.
