You are on a game show with three doors.
Behind one door is a car, behind the others are goats.
You pick door number 1.
The host opens door number 3, revealing a goat.
Should you switch to door number 2?
Most people think it doesn't matter - 50/50 chance.
But wait, let's think more carefully.
Your initial choice had 1/3 probability of being correct.
Door number 2 now has 2/3 probability of being correct.
The host's action provides information about the other doors.
Always switch - you double your chances of winning!
Achilles races a tortoise in a famous paradox.
The tortoise gets a 100-meter head start.
When Achilles reaches the 100-meter mark, the tortoise has moved to 110 meters.
When Achilles reaches 110 meters, the tortoise is at 111 meters.
This pattern continues infinitely.
How can Achilles ever catch the tortoise?
Each step seems to take finite time.
Infinite steps suggest infinite time.
But this reasoning is flawed.
Infinite terms can sum to a finite value.
This is a convergent geometric series.
The total time converges to a finite limit.
Achilles does catch the tortoise!
The Ship of Theseus poses a question about identity.
A ship has all its wooden parts gradually replaced.
Each old plank is replaced with a new identical one.
After all parts are replaced, is it the same ship?
What if the old parts are reassembled into another ship?
Which ship is the real Ship of Theseus?
Physical continuity seems to determine identity.
But functional continuity also matters.
The question reveals our assumptions about identity.
Identity can be relational, not absolute.
Different contexts require different identity criteria.
There may be no single correct answer.
Mathematics begins with counting concrete objects.
Two apples plus three apples equals five apples.
We then introduce variables for unknown quantities.
If x plus 3 equals 5, then x must equal 2.
Functions represent transformations between sets.
Function composition combines multiple transformations.
