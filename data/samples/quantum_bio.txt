Recent discoveries in quantum biology have revealed that quantum effects play a crucial role in biological processes.
Photosynthesis, for example, uses quantum coherence to achieve near-perfect energy transfer efficiency.

Birds may navigate using quantum entanglement in certain proteins in their eyes, allowing them to "see" magnetic fields.
This quantum compass relies on the spin states of electron pairs in cryptochrome proteins.

The discovery of quantum effects in warm, wet biological systems challenges our traditional understanding 
that quantum phenomena only occur in isolated, cold environments. This suggests life has evolved to harness quantum mechanics.
