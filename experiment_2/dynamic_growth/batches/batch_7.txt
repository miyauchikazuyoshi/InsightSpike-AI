Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a theoretical form of AI that would match or exceed human cognitive abilities across all domains. Unlike narrow AI, which excels at specific tasks, AGI would demonstrate human-like reasoning, learning, and problem-solving capabilities. The development of AGI remains one of the most significant challenges in computer science.\n\nThe transformer architecture, introduced in the 'Attention is All You Need' paper, revolutionized NLP by replacing recurrent layers with self-attention mechanisms. This allows for parallel processing of sequences and better capture of long-range dependencies. Models like BERT, GPT, and T5 are all based on transformer architecture.\n\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) extend deep learning to graph-structured data. They work by aggregating information from neighboring nodes through message passing. Applications include molecular property prediction, social network analysis, and knowledge graph reasoning. InsightSpike uses graph structures for efficient information storage.\n\n
