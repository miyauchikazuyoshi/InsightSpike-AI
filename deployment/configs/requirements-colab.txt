# InsightSpike-AI Colab Requirements
# Core dependencies for Poetry installation
# 
# STRATEGIC COORDINATION:
# - This file excludes torch and faiss to prevent installation conflicts
# - GPU-critical packages (torch, faiss) are installed separately via pip in setup scripts
# - Complete dependency list available in requirements-colab-comprehensive.txt
# - Use setup_colab.sh for coordinated installation
#
# Note: torch and faiss are installed separately in setup script for GPU optimization
