# Experiment Design
experiment:
  questions:
    - "What is the relationship between energy and information?"
    - "Why does consciousness emerge?"
    - "What is the mechanism of creativity at the edge of chaos?"
    - "What is entropy?"
    - "Can you explain quantum entanglement?"
    - "Is there a principle that unifies all phenomena?"
