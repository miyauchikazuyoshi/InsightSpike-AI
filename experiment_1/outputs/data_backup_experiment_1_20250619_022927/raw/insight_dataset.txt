You are on a game show with three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others are goats. You pick door #1. The host opens door #3, revealing a goat. Should you switch to door #2? This seems impossible! Most people think it doesn't matter - 50/50 chance. Each remaining door seems equally likely. The initial choice feels symmetrical. But wait... let's think more carefully. Your initial choice had 1/3 probability of being correct. Door #2 now has 2/3 probability of being correct. The host's action provides information. Always switch - you double your chances!

Achilles races a tortoise. The tortoise gets a head start. When Achilles reaches the tortoise's starting point, the tortoise has moved ahead. This continues infinitely. How can Achilles ever catch up? This seems impossible! Infinite steps suggest infinite time. Each step takes some finite time. The sum must be infinite. But wait... let's think more carefully.

This page lists some links to ancient philosophy, namely philosophical thought extending as far as early post-classical history (c. 600 CE).
Overview
Genuine philosophical thought, depending upon original individual insights, arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously.
This period ended with the rise of the Qin Dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent.
A main idea of Confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection.
Atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus.
Atomic physics typically refers to the study of atomic structure and the interaction between atoms.
It is primarily concerned with the way in which electrons are arranged around the nucleus and
the processes by which these arrangements change.
This comprises ions, neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the term atom includes ions.
Physics research groups are usually so classified.
The Annals of Mathematics is a mathematical journal published every two months by Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study.
History 

The journal was established as The Analyst in 1874 and with Joel E. Hendricks as the founding editor-in-chief.
It was published in Des Moines, Iowa, and was the earliest American mathematics journal to be published continuously for more than a year or two.
The new incarnation of the journal was edited by Ormond Stone (University of Virginia).
It moved to Harvard in 1899 before reaching its current home in Princeton in 1911.
It considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and if it does, how humans can detect it.
The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.
Nonetheless, Earth is the only place in the universe humans know to harbor life.
Overview 
The term was first proposed by the Russian (Soviet) astronomer Gavri
The cell (from the Latin word 'cellula' meaning "small room") is the basic structural and functional unit of life.
Every cell consists of a cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.
Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres.
Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure.
Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals).
death) of the Buddha and later spread throughout Asia.
The Buddhist path combines both philosophical reasoning and meditation.
A recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the reification of concepts, and the subsequent return to the Buddhist Middle Way.
Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different schools of Buddhism.
The third phase concerns Mahayana Buddhism, beginning in the late first century CE.
Biology – The natural science that studies life.
Areas of focus include structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.
The Consolation of Philosophy () is a philosophical work by the Roman statesman Boethius, written in 523 AD.
Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome, holding the prestigious office of magister officiorum, and was brought down by treachery.
It was described in 1891 as "by far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen."
Boethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and a female personification of philosophy.
She contends that happiness comes from within, and that virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperiled by the vicissitudes of fortune.
Computer science involves the study of or the practice of computation, automation, and information.
Computer science is generally considered an area of  academic research and distinct from computer programming.
Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of  problems that can be solved using them.
The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities.
More generally, the subject deals with "condensed" phases of matter: systems of many constituents with strong interactions between them.
The field overlaps with chemistry, materials science, engineering and nanotechnology, and relates closely to atomic physics and biophysics.
The theoretical physics of condensed matter shares important concepts and methods with that of particle physics and nuclear physics.
The Bell Telephone Laboratories was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics.
In the 1960s and 70s, some physicists felt the more comprehensive name better fit the funding en
"Critical philosophy" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself.
Although much of Chinese philosophy begun in the Warring States period, elements of Chinese philosophy have existed for several thousand years.
Some can be found in the I Ching (the Book of Changes), an ancient compendium of divination, which dates back to at least 672 BCE.
Even in modern society, Confucianism is still the creed of etiquette for Chinese society.
See Legitimacy of Chinese philosophy for details.
Early beliefs

Early Shang dynasty thought was based upon cycles.
History
Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks.
In 387 BCE, Plato is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.
Some of those involved in this debate included George Berkeley and John Locke on the side of empiricism, and Immanuel Kant on the side of nativism.
From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was behaviorism.
One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was Jean Piaget.
The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation.
The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field.
A vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational.
The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields.
The curl operator maps continuously differentiable functions  to continuous functions , and in particular, it maps  functions in  to  functions in .
Cell biology (also cellular biology or cytology) is a branch of biology that studies the structure, function and behavior of cells.
All living organisms are made of cells.
A cell is the basic unit of life that is responsible for the living and functioning of organisms.
Cell biology is the study of structural and functional units of cells.
The study of cells is performed using several microscopy techniques, cell culture, and cell fractionation.
The "Five Phases" are Fire (), Water (), Wood (), Metal or Gold (), and Earth or Soil ().
This order of presentation is known as the "Days of the Week" sequence.
In the order of "mutual generation" (), they are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water.
In the order of "mutual overcoming" (), they are Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal.
The system of five phases was used for describing interactions and relationships between phenomena.
In mathematics, in general topology, compactification is the process or result of making a topological space into a compact space.
A compact space is a space in which every open cover of the space contains a finite subcover.
An example

Consider the real line with its ordinary topology.
This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right.
It is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single "point at infinity" which we will denote by ∞.
In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.
The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer referenced—also called garbage.
Garbage collection was invented by American computer scientist John McCarthy around 1959 to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.
Other similar techniques include stack allocation, region inference, memory ownership, and combinations of multiple techniques.
Methods for managing such resources, particularly destructors, may suffice to manage memory as well, leaving no need for GC.
In physics, the cross section is a measure of the probability that a specific process will take place when some kind of radiant excitation (e.g.
a particle beam, sound wave, light, or an X-ray) intersects a localized phenomenon (e.g.
a particle or density fluctuation).
Cross section is typically denoted  (sigma) and is expressed in units of area, more specifically in barns.
If the particles are hard inelastic spheres that interact only upon contact, their scattering cross section is related to their geometric size.
The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) is a private, non-profit foundation dedicated to increasing and disseminating mathematical knowledge.
Formerly based in Peterborough, New Hampshire, the corporate address is now in Denver, Colorado.
CMI's scientific activities are managed from the President's office in Oxford, United Kingdom.
It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians.
The institute was founded in 1998 through the sponsorship of Boston businessman Landon T. Clay.
Critical psychology is a perspective on psychology that draws extensively on critical theory.
Conventional psychology does this, in part, by explaining behavior at the individual level.
Use of the term critical psychology started in the 1970s in Berlin at Freie Universität Berlin.
The German branch of critical psychology predates and has developed largely separately from the rest of the field.
As of May 2007, only a few works have been translated into English.
Developmental biology is the study of the process by which animals and plants grow and develop.
Regional specification refers to the processes that create spatial pattern in a ball or sheet of initially similar cells.
These are defined by the expression of specific combinations of transcription factors.
Cell differentiation relates specifically to the formation of functional cell types such as nerve, muscle, secretory epithelia etc.
Differentiated cells contain large amounts of specific proteins associated with the cell function.
Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic.
By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as real numbers, calculus or Euclidean geometry.
However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics".
The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite.
Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well.
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life.
Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan.
Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.
This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development.
Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and environmental factors.
A disperser is a related graph.
An equivalent way to view an extractor is as a bivariate function 

 

in the natural way.
Extractor functions were originally researched as a way to extract randomness from weakly random sources.
See randomness extractor.
Using the probabilistic method it is easy to show that extractor graphs with really good parameters exist.
For example, a patient who is overly argumentative might instead perceive others as argumentative and themselves as blameless.
Like other defense mechanisms, externalization is a protection against anxiety and is, therefore, part of a healthy, normally functioning mind.
However, if taken to excess, it can lead to the development of a neurosis.

Educational psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning.
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines.
It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology.
It is also informed by neuroscience.
Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences.

Physics is a branch of science whose primary objects of study are matter and energy.
Discoveries of physics find applications throughout the natural sciences and in technology.
Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics.
These mathematical disciplines began in antiquity with the Babylonians and with Hellenistic writers such as Archimedes and Ptolemy.
Ancient philosophy, meanwhile, included what was called "Physics".
The history of mathematics deals with the origin of discoveries in mathematics and the mathematical methods and notation of the past.
Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system and the first use of negative numbers.
Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.
From ancient times through the Middle Ages, periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation.
This includes the groundbreaking work of both Isaac Newton and Gottfrie
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.
Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values.
Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits).
The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers.
Computer hardware nearly always provides a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.
The study of series is a major part of calculus and its generalization, mathematical analysis.
Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in combinatorics) through generating functions.
For a long time, the idea that such a potentially infinite summation could produce a finite result was considered paradoxical.
This paradox was resolved using the concept of a limit during the 17th century.
Zeno concluded that Achilles could never reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist.
Differential psychology studies the ways in which individuals differ in their behavior and the processes that underlie it.
This is a discipline that develops classifications (taxonomies) of psychological individual differences.
This particular area of psychology was first named and still retains the name of “differential psychology” by William Stern in his book (1900).
His interest was further pursued by his half-cousin Francis Galton in his attempt to quantify individual differences among people.
This approach is applied because psychological research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people.
I-O psychology has also been known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, and work psychology.
Industrial, work and organizational psychology (IWO) is the broader, more global term for the field.
As an applied field, the discipline involves both research and practice.
I-O psychologists apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and the individuals within them.
I-O psychologists are trained in the scientist–practitioner model.
In physics, jerk or jolt is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time.
It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction).
Jerk is most commonly denoted by the symbol  and expressed in m/s3 (SI units) or standard gravities per second (g0/s).
This condition generates mathematical interest in jerk systems.
Systems involving fourth-order derivatives or higher are accordingly called hyperjerk systems.
For that reason, it is also known as a "helping theorem" or an "auxiliary theorem".
The word "lemma" derives from the Ancient Greek  ("anything which is received", such as a gift, profit, or a bribe).
Comparison with theorem
There is no formal distinction between a lemma and a theorem, only one of intention (see Theorem terminology).
However, a lemma can be considered a minor result whose sole purpose is to help prove a more substantial theorem – a step in the direction of proof.
Well-known lemmas
A good stepping stone can lead to many others.
There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.
Most of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects.
The result of a proof is called a theorem.
Mathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena.
This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws.
Metaphilosophy, sometimes called the philosophy of philosophy, is "the investigation of the nature of philosophy".
Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy, and its methods.
The interest in metaphilosophy led to the establishment of the journal Metaphilosophy in January 1970.
Timothy Williamson argues that the philosophy of philosophy is "automatically part of philosophy", as is the philosophy of anything else.
Many philosophers have expressed doubts over the value of metaphilosophy.
The word "metaphysics" comes from two Greek words that, together, literally mean "after or behind or among [the study of] the natural".
Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are.
Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions:
 What ?
Topics of metaphysical investigation include existence, objects and their properties, space and time, cause and effect, and possibility.
Metaphysics is considered one of the four main branches of philosophy, along with epistemology, logic, and ethics.
A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed.
This concept is especially important in Continental philosophy, where 'the subject' is a central term in debates over the nature of the self.
The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the philosophy of René Descartes, between thought and extension.
Descartes believed that thought (subjectivity) was the essence of the mind, and that extension (the occupation of space) was the essence of matter.
The idealists' starting point that Hume's conclusion that there is nothing to the self over and above a big, fleeting bundle of perceptions.
The study of chemical and physical structure of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology.
In 1945 the term molecular biology was used by physicist William Astbury.
One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983.
The central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.
Advances in molecular biology have been closely related to the development of new technologies and their optimization.
These three conditions, called group axioms, hold for number systems and many other mathematical structures.
For example, the integers together with the addition operation form a group.
These examples were at the origin of the concept of group (together with Galois groups).
Lie groups arise as symmetry groups in geometry but appear also in the Standard Model of particle physics.
The Poincaré group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity.

In mathematics, a filter or order filter is a special subset of a partially ordered set.
Filters appear in order and lattice theory, but can also be found in topology, from which they originate.
The dual notion of a filter is an order ideal.
Similarly, a filter on a set contains those subsets that are sufficiently large to contain some given .
However, they do not really, without elaboration, explain condition 2 of the general definition.
These seemingly distinct concepts have many similarities and can often be treated as mathematically indistinguishable.
Measures are foundational in probability theory, integration theory, and can be generalized to assume negative values, as with electrical charge.
Far-reaching generalizations of measure are widely used in quantum physics and physics in general.
The intuition behind this concept dates back to Ancient Greece, when Archimedes tried to calculate the area of a circle.
But it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that measure theory became a branch of mathematics.
